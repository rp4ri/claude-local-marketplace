## Subject Line Craft

Subject lines are the most critical copy in any email — they determine whether the email gets opened.

**Formula library:**

| Formula | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **Number + benefit** | "5 ways to cut design time in half" |
| **Question** | "Is your design system slowing you down?" |
| **How-to** | "How top teams ship design 3× faster" |
| **Curiosity gap** | "We've been keeping something from you" |
| **Direct offer** | "Your free trial starts today" |
| **Urgency** | "Last chance: offer ends at midnight" |
| **Personalized** | "{{{FIRST_NAME}}}, your dashboard is ready" |
| **Re-engagement** | "We miss you. Here's 20% off" |

**Subject line rules:**
- 30–50 characters (shows fully on mobile)
- Never use ALL CAPS or excessive punctuation (spam signals)
- Test emoji — works for some audiences, not others
- Avoid spam trigger words: "free", "guarantee", "winner", "urgent", "act now"
- A/B test subject lines on 20% of list before full send

---

## Preview Text (Preheader)

Preview text appears next to the subject in most inboxes — it's essentially a second subject line.

**Rules:**
- 40–90 characters (varies by client)
- Complement the subject, don't repeat it
- If not set, inbox shows first visible text in email (often looks bad)
- Pad with invisible characters: `&zwnj;&nbsp;` to prevent overflow spillover

**Examples:**
- Subject: "Your order is confirmed" → Preview: "Delivery estimated Thursday, Mar 14"
- Subject: "New feature: dark mode is here" → Preview: "Switch between themes instantly — no extra setup needed"
- Subject: "5 ways to cut design time" → Preview: "Plus a free template pack inside"

## Email Body Structure

### The AIDA Framework
1. **Attention** — Hero headline that hooks immediately
2. **Interest** — 1–2 sentences expanding on the hook
3. **Desire** — Benefits (not features), social proof, specifics
4. **Action** — Single, clear CTA

### Copywriting Principles

**Lead with the reader, not the brand:**
- ❌ "We're excited to announce that we've launched..."
- ✓ "You can now do X in half the time."

**Benefits over features:**
- ❌ "Version 3.0 includes a new sync engine"
- ✓ "Your designs stay in sync automatically — no more manual exports"

**Use second-person singular (you/your):**
- Makes the email feel personal, not broadcast

**Short paragraphs:**
- Max 3 sentences per paragraph
- 1 sentence is often ideal
- White space is copy too

**Active voice:**
- ❌ "Your account has been created"
- ✓ "You're in — here's your account"

---

## CTA Copy

The button/link text is the most action-critical copy. It must be specific and low-friction.

**Weak → Strong CTA copy:**
| Weak | Strong |
|------|--------|
| "Click here" | "See your report" |
| "Learn more" | "Read the full guide" |
| "Submit" | "Get my free template" |
| "Buy now" | "Start my 14-day trial" |
| "Sign up" | "Join 10,000 designers" |

**CTA rules:**
- One primary CTA per email (two CTAs split attention by 50%)
- Position CTA above the fold AND after the body copy
- First-person phrasing increases clicks: "Get MY quote" vs "Get your quote"
- Action + outcome: verb + what they get

## Email Type Tone Guides

| Email Type | Tone | Length | Key Copy Elements |
|-----------|------|--------|-------------------|
| **Welcome** | Warm, confident | Medium | Brand promise, quick win, set expectations |
| **Transactional** | Clear, efficient | Short | Confirmation, key details, next step |
| **Newsletter** | Conversational | Variable | Hook intro, curated value, editorial voice |
| **Promotional** | Energetic, urgent | Short-medium | Headline benefit, offer specifics, deadline |
| **Onboarding** | Helpful, encouraging | Short | One task, one win, progress |
| **Re-engagement** | Personal, humble | Short | Acknowledge absence, single soft ask |
| **Winback** | Direct, incentive-led | Short | Offer + deadline, easy reply |

---

## Multi-Email Sequence Strategy

### Welcome Sequence (5 emails)
1. **Day 0** — Confirmation + quick win ("Here's your first template")
2. **Day 2** — Origin story + social proof (builds trust)
3. **Day 5** — Core value prop + feature spotlight
4. **Day 9** — Case study or success story
5. **Day 14** — Soft offer or next step CTA

### Onboarding Sequence (3–7 emails)
- One email = one action
- Progress signals ("Step 2 of 3: Connect your team")
- Each email's subject references where they are in the journey

### Re-engagement Sequence (3 emails)
1. "We've missed you" — gentle, no pressure
2. Value reminder — "Here's what you've been missing"
3. Final ask — "Should we remove you?" (reverse psychology — high open rates)

---

## A/B Testing Priorities

Test in this order (highest to lowest impact on revenue):

1. **Subject line** — affects open rate (biggest lever)
2. **CTA copy** — affects click rate
3. **CTA color/placement** — affects click rate
4. **Hero headline** — affects engagement
5. **Email length** — affects read rate

**Statistical significance:** Need minimum 1,000 recipients per variant, 95% confidence before declaring a winner.

---

## Personalization Variables

Beyond first name, effective personalizations:
- **Company name**: `{{{COMPANY_NAME}}}` — strong for B2B
- **Last activity**: "You last logged in 14 days ago"
- **Stage/segment**: "As a [free/pro/enterprise] user..."
- **Behavior-triggered**: "You started a trial but haven't invited your team"
- **Geographic**: "Teams in {{{CITY}}} love this feature"

---

## Compliance Copy Requirements

- **Unsubscribe link** — required in every email (CAN-SPAM, CASL, GDPR)
- **Physical address** — required (CAN-SPAM)
- **Honest subject line** — cannot be deceptive (CAN-SPAM)
- **No pre-checked opt-ins** — required for GDPR compliance
- Transactional emails (receipts, password resets) are exempt from CAN-SPAM marketing rules but must not contain promotional content

---

## QA Checklist

- [ ] Subject line under 50 characters and tested for spam triggers
- [ ] Preview text set and complements subject (not a repeat)
- [ ] One primary CTA with specific, action-oriented copy
- [ ] Benefits-first body copy (not feature-first)
- [ ] Short paragraphs (≤3 sentences)
- [ ] Personalization tokens present where appropriate
- [ ] Unsubscribe link copy present and friendly ("Unsubscribe" or "Manage preferences")
- [ ] Compliance copy: physical address, honest subject
- [ ] Plain text version has equivalent copy
- [ ] A/B test variant for subject line prepared if list > 1,000

---

## Handoffs

- **To Email Designer**: Provide subject, preview text, headline, body copy, CTA text, footer copy as a content brief before HTML coding begins
- **To Design Manager**: Flag if sequence requires triggered/behavioral automation logic (needs ESP workflow configuration)

## Advanced Patterns

### Subject Line Formula Library

5 deeper patterns with analysis (complements the formula quick-reference table above):

**1. Specificity** (most reliable)
> "Your invoice for $240 is ready"
> "3 new comments on 'Homepage redesign'"
> "Your trial ends in 3 days"
Specificity signals relevance. Vague subjects get ignored; specific ones get opened.

**2. Curiosity gap**
> "The one thing we changed in v2.0"
> "Why your LCP score is probably wrong"
Create a knowledge gap, then close it inside the email. Don't be clickbait — the email must deliver on the subject.

**3. Urgency + specificity**
> "48 hours left: your export is waiting"
> "Last chance: free migration help ends Friday"
Urgency without specificity is spam. Urgency + specificity is useful.

**4. Social proof**
> "1,200 agencies signed up this month"
> "How [Company] cut design review time by 60%"
Works for nurture sequences. Avoid for transactional or onboarding emails.

**5. Direct benefit**
> "Your design system, now with dark mode support"
> "Design Studio now works in Figma — here's how"
Best for product update emails. Lead with the user benefit, not the feature name.

**Anti-patterns:** ALL CAPS, excessive punctuation (!!!!!), misleading teasers, "Re:" or "Fwd:" tricks, using the recipient's name if it adds no value.

---

### Preview Text Strategy

Preview text is the second subject line — it appears in the inbox below/beside the subject.

**Rules:**
- Never repeat the subject line — extend the thought or add a secondary hook
- 40–90 characters for full display across clients
- Write it before you write the email body — it keeps you focused on the core message
- If you don't set preview text, email clients pull the first line of body content (often ugly: "View in browser | Unsubscribe")

**Examples:**
| Subject | Preview text |
|---|---|
| "Your trial ends in 3 days" | "Here's what you'll lose access to — and how to keep it." |
| "v3.0 is live" | "Dark mode, 12 new commands, and a complete Figma rewrite." |
| "New comment from Sarah" | "She left a note on your homepage redesign wireframes." |

---

### CTA Copy Decision Guide

**The formula:** Verb + Object (+ Context when helpful)
- ✅ "Download your report"
- ✅ "Start your free trial"
- ✅ "View Sarah's comment"
- ❌ "Click here"
- ❌ "Learn more"
- ❌ "Submit"

**Single primary CTA per email.** If you have two goals, write two emails. Multiple CTAs reduce clicks on all of them.

**Button vs. text link:**
- Button: primary action, conversion-focused emails
- Text link: supplementary links, transactional details ("view invoice", "update preferences")
- Never use only text links for the primary CTA — they get missed

**Placement:**
- Primary CTA: above the fold (visible without scrolling) + repeated at the bottom of long emails
- At the bottom: after you've made the case, when the reader is most persuaded

### Drip Sequence Psychology

*This arc applies to SaaS products with a clear activation milestone. For content-first or newsletter products, see Welcome Sequence above.*

**The sequence arc:**

| Email | Timing | Goal | Tone |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Welcome** | Immediately | Deliver the promised value, orient the user | Warm, focused |
| **Onboarding 1** | Day 2 | First meaningful product action | Helpful, instructional |
| **Onboarding 2** | Day 4 | Second value milestone | Encouraging |
| **Nurture** | Week 2+ | Teach something valuable (no pitch) | Educational, generous |
| **Consideration** | Week 3–4 | Social proof, case study, objection handling | Confident |
| **Conversion** | Week 4–5 | Clear offer with urgency | Direct, benefit-led |
| **Re-engagement** | Day 30 of inactivity | Acknowledge the gap, give a reason to return | Low-pressure |
| **Win-back** | Day 60 of inactivity | Last attempt before suppression | Honest, generous |

**Frequency rule:** Users should receive no more than 2–3 marketing emails per week from you. More = unsubscribes.

**Content arc:** Teach → show proof → make offer. Don't pitch before you've given value. The ratio should be roughly 3:1 (value emails to pitch emails).

### Segmentation Copy Adaptation

The same email should read differently for different user segments:

**New users vs. power users:**
- New user: more context, more explanation, softer CTAs ("Get started")
- Power user: less hand-holding, specific features, stronger CTAs ("Enable it now")
- Use dynamic content blocks in your ESP to swap sections based on user attribute

**When to send separate emails vs. personalize one:**
- Separate emails: when the entire message changes (onboarding for free vs. paid is different enough to be a different email)
- Personalize one: when the core message is the same but 1–2 details differ (name, plan, specific feature they use)

**Tone adaptation by segment:**
- Churned users: lower stakes, no pressure, generous offer
- High-value users: acknowledge their status, give them early access or exclusive content
- Users who haven't activated: patient, instructional, address common blockers

---

### A/B Testing Email Copy

**Test in this order:**

1. **Subject line** (biggest impact — affects open rate, which affects everything downstream)
2. **CTA copy** (affects click rate directly)
3. **Headline** (first thing read after open)
4. **Send time** (test Tuesday 10am vs. Thursday 2pm for your audience)
5. **Length** (short vs. long — audience dependent)

**Writing variants that test one variable:** Change only the subject line in variant B — don't also change the preview text. One variable per test.

**Minimum send volume per variant:** 1,000+ recipients per variant for statistical significance on open rate. 5,000+ for click rate significance (lower base rate = needs more volume).

**How to read results:**
- Subject line test → look at open rate (48–72h window)
- CTA test → look at click-to-open rate (not raw click rate — controls for open rate variation)
- Apply winner to the rest of the list once significance is reached (typically p < 0.05)

## Reference-Sourced Insights

### Subject Line Psychology (From Litmus, Campaign Monitor)

**The specificity rule is the most reliable opener pattern.** Vague subjects get skipped; specific ones feel personally relevant:
- ❌ "Your account update" → ✓ "Your invoice for $240 is ready"
- ❌ "Check this out" → ✓ "3 new comments on 'Homepage redesign'"
- ❌ "Time is running out" → ✓ "Your trial ends in 3 days"

**The curiosity-gap trap:** The email must deliver what the subject promises. Curiosity gaps that don't pay off destroy trust and drive unsubscribes on the second email. Write the subject *after* writing the email body, not before — this prevents click-bait drift.

**Word-count sweet spot:** 6–10 words (30–50 characters) is the mobile-visible range. Subject lines longer than 9 words are truncated on most smartphone screens.

**Emoji usage rule:** Test emoji on your specific audience before using them consistently. B2B audiences (finance, legal, enterprise IT) typically respond negatively. Consumer/lifestyle audiences respond positively. Never lead with emoji — the first character should be a word.

**Subject anti-patterns that signal spam filters:**
- ALL CAPS anywhere in the subject
- More than one exclamation mark (`!!`)
- Misleading "Re:" or "Fwd:" prefixes
- Dollar signs followed by a number in the first 3 words
- The word "free" without context (e.g. "Free trial" is OK; "FREE gift inside" triggers filters)

---

### Preview Text as a Second Subject Line

**The most commonly wasted real estate in email.** If you don't set preview text, email clients pull the first visible text in the body — which is often "View in browser | Unsubscribe", destroying the impression before the email is even opened.

**Write preview text before writing the email body** — it forces clarity about the core message.

**The extend-don't-repeat rule:**
- Never copy the subject line into the preview text
- Don't start with the brand name (it's already in the sender field)
- Do: add a secondary hook, a specific detail, or a piece of value the subject teased

**Pattern: Subject sets up the promise → Preview delivers a specific detail:**
| Subject | Preview text |
|---|---|
| "Your trial ends in 3 days" | "Here's what you'll lose access to — and how to keep it." |
| "New: dark mode is live" | "Switch themes instantly — works across all your projects." |
| "5 ways to cut design time" | "Plus a free template pack included." |

**Length targeting:** Aim for 85–100 characters — long enough to fill the preview pane on desktop (which shows more than mobile), short enough to not be cut on mobile.

---

### CTA Copy Precision (From Litmus, Real-world patterns)

**The one-to-five word rule:** Litmus data shows CTA copy exceeding 5 words performs worse. The rarity of a long CTA makes it stand out, but as a default, keep it short and action-specific.

**First-person phrasing:** "Get MY report" outperforms "Get your report" in click-rate tests by ~14–17% (from Michael Aagaard / ContentVerve CRO testing, 2012 — frequently cited but a single study; results vary by audience and context). Use first-person when the CTA is about something the user owns or receives:
- ✓ "Download my template"
- ✓ "Start my free trial"
- ✓ "See my dashboard"
- ✗ "Read our blog" (brand-owned content — use second-person or neutral)

**Ghost buttons in email:** Outline/ghost buttons (border only, transparent fill) perform significantly worse than solid filled buttons. In email, where rendering is inconsistent, ghost buttons can disappear entirely. Use solid filled buttons for all primary CTAs.

**Placement redundancy:** For emails over 400px in body height, place the primary CTA both above the fold AND at the bottom after the argument is made. The top CTA serves scanners; the bottom CTA serves readers. Don't add a third — that's too much.

---

### Sequence Timing and Frequency (From industry standards)

**The 3:1 value-to-pitch ratio:** Send 3 emails that provide value (teach something, share something useful, celebrate the user) for every 1 email that makes an offer. Violating this ratio increases unsubscribe rate.

**Frequency ceiling:** No more than 2–3 marketing emails per week per sender. Above that, unsubscribes accelerate regardless of content quality.

**Re-engagement sequence psychology:** The third email in a re-engagement sequence — "Should we remove you from our list?" — consistently generates the highest open rates of any re-engagement email. The subject line "Is this goodbye?" outperforms soft re-engagement subjects by 3–5x. The reverse psychology works because it signals respect for the reader's time.

**Behavioral trigger emails outperform blast emails:** Emails triggered by a specific user action (signed up, hit a milestone, went 30 days inactive) generate 3–5x higher click rates than equivalent scheduled blast emails, because they're contextually relevant at the moment of sending.

---

### Transactional Email Rules (From CAN-SPAM compliance)

Transactional emails (receipts, password resets, shipping confirmations) are **exempt from CAN-SPAM marketing rules** but must follow these constraints:
- Transactional status is determined by "primary purpose": if a reasonable recipient would interpret the primary reason for the email as commercial promotion, it loses the exemption. There is no FTC-specified percentage threshold — the standard is qualitative, not quantitative. A practical guideline: promotional content should be clearly secondary and subordinate to the transactional information
- Must clearly identify the transaction in the subject line
- Still require physical address
- Must not add users to marketing lists without explicit opt-in at the time of signup

**Transactional email design principle:** Remove everything except what the recipient needs to complete or confirm their action. One purpose, one action, no distractions. These are the highest-opened emails you'll send — don't dilute them.

---

### Segmentation and Personalization Beyond First Name (Practical patterns)

**High-impact personalization variables beyond `{{{FIRST_NAME}}}`:**
- `{{{COMPANY_NAME}}}` — highest lift for B2B emails, especially in subject line
- `{{{PLAN_NAME}}}` / `{{{TIER}}}` — "As a Pro user..." sets correct expectations
- `{{{DAYS_SINCE_LAST_LOGIN}}}` — "You haven't logged in for 14 days" is more compelling than "We miss you"
- `{{{LAST_FEATURE_USED}}}` — "Last time you were using [feature]..." grounds the email in the user's reality
- `{{{TRIAL_DAYS_REMAINING}}}` — "You have 3 days left" beats "Your trial is ending soon"

**Dynamic content blocks vs. separate emails:**
- Use dynamic blocks (ESP-level content swapping) when the core message is identical but 1–3 details differ
- Write completely separate emails when the entire tone, CTA, and body change (e.g., free vs. paid onboarding)
- Separate emails always outperform poorly-personalized single emails

**Suppress users from promotional sequences when they've already converted** — sending "upgrade to Pro" to someone already on Pro is a trust-destroying mistake that's entirely preventable with list segmentation.
