## Design Context Extraction

### Available Figma MCP Tools

Two Figma MCP servers may be available — the URL-based one (requires fileKey + nodeId) and the desktop one (works with current selection). Check which is available:

**URL-based tools** (require fileKey and nodeId from Figma URLs):
- `get_design_context` — Primary tool. Returns reference code, screenshot, and metadata.
- `get_screenshot` — Screenshot of a specific node
- `get_metadata` — XML structure overview (node IDs, names, positions)
- `get_variable_defs` — Design token variables for a node
- `get_code_connect_map` — Maps nodes to codebase components

**Desktop tools** (work with currently selected node in Figma desktop app):
- Same tools but don't require fileKey/nodeId parameters

### Extracting from URLs

When the user provides a Figma URL like:
```
https://figma.com/design/AbCdEf/MyFile?node-id=123-456
```

Extract:
- **fileKey**: `AbCdEf`
- **nodeId**: `123:456` (convert `-` to `:`)

For branch URLs:
```
https://figma.com/design/AbCdEf/branch/GhIjKl/MyFile
```
Use the branchKey (`GhIjKl`) as the fileKey.

### What get_design_context Returns

The primary tool returns:
1. **Reference code**: HTML/CSS representation of the design (adapt, don't copy verbatim)
2. **Screenshot**: Visual reference for the node
3. **Asset download URLs**: Images, icons referenced in the design
4. **Metadata**: Node structure, names, dimensions

---

## Figma-to-Code Workflow

### Step 1: Get the Design Context

```
Call get_design_context with nodeId and fileKey
```

This gives you the reference code and screenshot. The reference code is a starting point — it represents the design's visual structure but needs adaptation for production use.

### Step 2: Analyze the Design

From the returned data, identify:
- **Layout structure**: Flex/grid, spacing, alignment
- **Typography**: Font families, sizes, weights, line heights
- **Colors**: Background, text, border, and accent colors
- **Components**: Repeating patterns that should be componentized
- **Assets**: Images and icons that need downloading
- **States**: Look for variants that indicate hover, active, disabled states
- **Responsive hints**: Fixed vs. fluid widths, breakpoint patterns

### Step 3: Adapt to Production Code

The reference code from Figma is a guide, not final output. Adapt it:

**DO:**
- Map Figma colors to existing design tokens
- Use existing component patterns from the project
- Apply responsive patterns (Figma designs are usually single-breakpoint)
- Add interaction states (hover, focus, active)
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Apply accessibility attributes

**DON'T:**
- Copy pixel values verbatim (use rem/em, token values)
- Use absolute positioning unless truly needed
- Hard-code widths that should be responsive
- Ignore existing project conventions

### Step 4: Download Assets

The response includes download URLs for referenced assets. Download and save them to the project's asset directory.

### Step 5: Implement and Compare

Build the component, then compare visually:
1. Use the Preview MCP to see your implementation
2. Compare side-by-side with the Figma screenshot
3. Iterate until the implementation matches

---

## Code Connect

Code Connect maps Figma components to codebase components, creating a bridge between design and code.

### Checking Existing Mappings

Use `get_code_connect_map` to see if components are already mapped:
```
{
  "1:2": {
    "codeConnectSrc": "src/components/Button.tsx",
    "codeConnectName": "Button"
  }
}
```

If mappings exist, use the referenced components in your implementation rather than rebuilding from scratch.

### Adding New Mappings

Use `add_code_connect_map` to map a Figma component to its code equivalent:
- **nodeId**: The Figma node ID
- **fileKey**: The Figma file key
- **source**: Path to the component in the codebase
- **componentName**: Name of the component in code
- **label**: Framework label (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.)

### Using get_code_connect_suggestions

For complex designs, use `get_code_connect_suggestions` to get AI-suggested mappings, then review and confirm with `send_code_connect_mappings`.

## Adapting Design to Code

### Common Figma-to-CSS Translations

| Figma property | CSS equivalent |
|---------------|---------------|
| Auto Layout (horizontal) | `display: flex; flex-direction: row;` |
| Auto Layout (vertical) | `display: flex; flex-direction: column;` |
| Gap | `gap: Xpx;` |
| Padding | `padding: top right bottom left;` |
| Fill (solid) | `background-color: #hex;` |
| Fill (gradient) | `background: linear-gradient(...)` |
| Stroke | `border: Xpx solid #hex;` |
| Corner radius | `border-radius: Xpx;` |
| Drop shadow | `box-shadow: X Y blur spread #hex;` |
| Blend mode | `mix-blend-mode: mode;` |
| Opacity | `opacity: 0.X;` |
| Clip content | `overflow: hidden;` |

### Figma Variables to CSS Tokens

When `get_variable_defs` returns variables:
```json
{
  "icon/default/secondary": "#949494",
  "spacing/md": "16px",
  "radius/lg": "12px"
}
```

Map to your token system:
```css
--color-icon-secondary: #949494;
--spacing-md: 16px;
--radius-lg: 12px;
```

### Handling Design Ambiguity

Figma designs often leave things implied:
- **Hover states**: If not explicitly designed, darken/lighten 10% for hover
- **Mobile layout**: If only desktop is designed, stack columns and increase padding
- **Loading states**: Add skeleton screens matching the layout shape
- **Error states**: Add inline validation styles near form inputs
- **Focus states**: Add visible focus rings matching the brand color
- **Overflow**: Decide truncation strategy (line-clamp, ellipsis, scroll)

Always clarify with the user if the design intent is ambiguous rather than guessing wrong.

## Figma-Native Design Creation

The workflows above cover **extracting designs from Figma → code**. This section covers the reverse: **creating designs directly inside Figma** using the figma-console MCP Desktop Bridge.

### When to Use Figma Creation

- UX design challenges that require Figma deliverables (wireframes, component sets, style sheets)
- Setting up design systems natively in Figma (Paint Styles, Text Styles, Variables)
- Building wireframes or prototypes that stay in Figma for designer collaboration
- Creating component libraries with variants directly in the Figma file
- Any task where the output is a Figma file, not code

### figma-console MCP Tools

The Desktop Bridge provides write access to Figma via WebSocket. Key tool categories:

| Category | Tools | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| **Connection** | `figma_get_status`, `figma_reconnect` | Verify/establish Bridge connection |
| **Execution** | `figma_execute` | Run arbitrary JS in Figma plugin context |
| **Nodes** | `figma_create_child`, `figma_move_node`, `figma_resize_node`, `figma_delete_node`, `figma_rename_node`, `figma_clone_node` | Manipulate Figma nodes |
| **Fills/Strokes** | `figma_set_fills`, `figma_set_strokes` | Apply colors and borders |
| **Text** | `figma_set_text` | Set text content on text nodes |
| **Components** | `figma_search_components`, `figma_instantiate_component`, `figma_set_instance_properties` | Work with components |
| **Variables** | `figma_setup_design_tokens`, `figma_batch_create_variables`, `figma_batch_update_variables` | Create design tokens |
| **Validation** | `figma_capture_screenshot`, `figma_take_screenshot` | Visual validation |
| **File structure** | `figma_get_file_data`, `figma_get_selection` | Read file/selection state |

### Connection Workflow

1. User opens their Figma file in **Figma Desktop** (not browser)
2. Right-click canvas → Plugins → Development → **Figma Desktop Bridge**
3. Bridge connects via WebSocket (typically port 9223+)
4. Verify: `figma_get_status` → should show `"transport": "websocket"`

### Creating vs Extracting

| Aspect | Extraction (existing) | Creation (new) |
|--------|----------------------|----------------|
| **Direction** | Figma → Code | Code → Figma |
| **Primary tools** | `get_design_context`, `get_screenshot` | `figma_execute`, `figma_create_child` |
| **MCP server** | Figma (URL-based or desktop) | figma-console (Desktop Bridge) |
| **Connection** | REST API (works with just a URL) | WebSocket (requires Desktop Bridge running) |
| **Output** | HTML/CSS/JS files | Figma nodes, styles, components |

## Advanced Patterns

### Component Naming System

A consistent naming system makes components findable, understandable, and maintainable.

**Structure:** `Category/Subcategory/Variant`
- `Button/Primary/Default`
- `Button/Primary/Hover`
- `Form/Input/Error`
- `Navigation/Sidebar/Collapsed`

**Variant properties vs. component names:**
- Use variant properties for: states (default/hover/focus), sizes (sm/md/lg), themes (light/dark)
- Use separate components (or pages) for: structurally different layouts, components that share a name but nothing else
- Rule: if you'd use `if/else` logic in code to switch between them, they're variants. If they're truly different components, name them separately.

**Naming for search discoverability:**
- Use terms developers and designers both use, not internal nicknames
- Don't abbreviate ("Button" not "btn", "Navigation" not "nav") — full words search better
- Use the same terms as your design system documentation

**Deprecated components:**
- Prefix with `_` (e.g., `_Button/Legacy`) — `_` sorts to the bottom and signals "don't use"
- Add a description: "Use Button/Primary instead. Removing in v4."
- Never delete deprecated components mid-sprint — give consumers a cycle to migrate

---

### Auto-Layout Edge Cases

**Hug vs. Fill vs. Fixed — decision guide:**
| Setting | Use when |
|---|---|
| **Hug** | Component should shrink/grow to fit its content (badges, chips, pills) |
| **Fill** | Component should take up all available space in its parent (full-width buttons, input fields) |
| **Fixed** | Size must not change regardless of content (icon containers, avatar frames, fixed-width columns) |

**Nested auto-layout patterns:**
- Row inside column: the most common pattern for card layouts (column = card, row = each content section)
- Spacing modes: "Packed" for grouped items, "Space between" for navigation bars and toolbar items
- When mixing hug and fill: the fill child takes remaining space after hug children claim their natural size

**When auto-layout breaks:**
- Absolute-positioned elements (badges, notification dots): remove from auto-layout flow with "absolute position" and position relative to parent
- Overlapping layers: use negative spacing (gap) to pull layers together, or use absolute positioning
- Clip content + overflow: enable "Clip content" on the parent when children should be hidden outside the frame

---

### Variable & Token Architecture

**Three-tier hierarchy:**
```
Primitive tokens      →    Semantic tokens      →    Component tokens
(brand-blue-500)           (color-action-primary)     (button-bg-default)
     ↑                           ↑                          ↑
What it is               What it means              Where it's used
Never reference directly  Reference in components    Optional — use only for complex components
```

**When to create a new token vs. reuse:**
- New token: it has a distinct semantic meaning that could change independently
- Reuse: it's the same concept, just a different instance of the same usage

**Scope decisions:**
- Local tokens: for one component or feature only
- Published to library: for shared use across the team
- Multi-mode (light/dark): use variable modes, not duplicate variables

**Multi-brand token structure:**
- Primitive layer stays the same
- Semantic layer swaps per brand (brand A: `--color-primary: brand-blue-500`, brand B: `--color-primary: brand-green-600`)
- Component tokens inherit from semantic — they update automatically when brand switches

---

### Large File Organisation

**When to split into multiple files:**
- Team > 4 designers working simultaneously (merge conflicts become costly)
- File performance degrades (thumbnails take >2s to load)
- Logical separation exists: foundations file (tokens, primitives) + components file + product screens file

**Page organisation pattern:**
```
📄 Cover          — file name, version, last updated
📄 Foundations    — color tokens, type styles, spacing
📄 Components     — all components (or split by category for large systems)
📄 Patterns       — multi-component compositions (forms, cards, tables)
📄 Screens        — product flows
📄 Archive        — deprecated, do not use
```

**Layer naming discipline at scale:**
- Name every frame, group, and component instance
- Unnamed layers (`Frame 47`, `Rectangle 12`) make handoff impossible
- Convention: use the content or purpose as the name ("Hero section", "Pricing card — Pro tier")

---

### Branching Strategy

**Use branches for:**
- Significant redesigns that affect multiple components (would break others if merged mid-work)
- Client review (branch isolates in-review work from production designs)
- Experimental explorations (not sure it'll ship — don't pollute main)

**Don't branch for:**
- Quick fixes and corrections (just update main directly)
- Small additions that don't affect existing components

**Branch naming convention:** `[type]/[descriptor]`
- `feature/onboarding-redesign`
- `review/client-v2-feedback`
- `experiment/dark-mode-exploration`

**Review workflow before merging:**
1. Request review from at least one other designer
2. Document what changed (short description in the branch description)
3. Reviewer checks: are existing component usages still correct? Any unintended side effects?
4. Merge + archive the branch (don't delete — keep for reference)

## Full Coverage

### Component Audit Methodology

How to audit an existing library systematically:

**1. Inventory** — What exists?
- List every component by name
- Note which page/file it lives in

**2. Usage** — What's actually used?
- Search for instances in product screens: Figma's "Select all instances" feature
- Components with 0 instances in product screens = potentially unused (confirm before deleting)
- Components with 50+ instances = high-impact, treat with care

**3. Quality** — Does it meet current standards?
- Check: auto-layout implemented correctly?
- Check: all required states present?
- Check: tokens applied (not hardcoded values)?
- Check: accessibility properties set (role, label)?

**4. Gap** — What's missing?
- Compare component list against design patterns used in product screens
- Patterns used repeatedly without a component = candidates for extraction

**5. Debt** — What needs fixing?
- Prioritise by: usage count × severity of issue
- High usage + broken token → fix now
- Low usage + missing state → backlog

### Design Token Migration

Migrating from hardcoded values to tokens — how to do it without breaking everything:

**Migrate in this order:**
1. **Color first** — highest visual impact, easiest to audit with grep/find
2. **Spacing second** — high frequency, enables density variants later
3. **Typography third** — text styles, not just font size
4. **Elevation/shadow last** — most contextual, most risk of breaking visual hierarchy

**The "find all" workflow:**
1. Use Figma's "Select all with same fill" to find all instances of a hardcoded color
2. Replace with the appropriate token
3. Verify visually (no style should visibly change — only the reference changes)

**Validating completeness:**
- After migration: use Figma plugin "Token Inspector" or "Design Lint" to find remaining hardcoded values
- Target: zero hardcoded color values in published components

---

### Team Library Governance

**Who can publish changes:**
- Designate 1–2 "library owners" per component category
- Changes from contributors need review before publishing
- Breaking changes (rename, remove, restructure) need a migration guide

**Review process for component changes:**
1. Branch: make the change on a branch
2. Notify: post in team channel with screenshot of before/after
3. Review period: 48h for small changes, 1 week for breaking changes
4. Merge: library owner approves and publishes

**Versioning and deprecation communication:**
- Use Figma's component description field: "Deprecated in v4. Use [NewComponent] instead."
- Announce deprecations in Slack/team channel with migration timeline
- Never remove a component without a replacement and at least 2-week notice

**Breaking changes (rename/restructure):**
- Document before/after mapping: "Button/Solid → Button/Primary"
- Provide a migration session or document
- Keep the old version live in `Archive` page for 1 sprint after migration

## Handoffs

- **Product Designer** — Organized, named Figma file with cover frame and page structure handed off when design sessions conclude
- **UI Designer** — Developer-ready specs (auto-layout, explicit sizing, named components) handed off when screens reach hi-fi
- **Framework Specialist** — Exported design tokens (JSON/CSS) and asset files handed off when implementation begins
- **Design System Lead** — New component proposals and local styles that should be promoted to the shared library handed off after each design cycle
- **Content Designer** — Text layers identified for copy review handed off when layout is locked

## Reference-Sourced Insights

### Early Developer Involvement Rewrites the Handoff Model (From Figma Developer Handoff Guide)

- The traditional handoff model — designer finishes, tosses final screens over a fence — created ambiguity, surprises, and frustration on both sides. The fix is not a better spec document; it's inviting developers into Figma **during** design, not after. Dropbox, Expedia, and Cash App all restructured their workflows around this principle.
- Give developers Viewer access (free, no paid license required) from day one. Viewers can inspect designs, view the code panel, export assets, comment, and navigate prototypes — everything they need without editing access risks.
- Share a single Figma file link (not exported screens) in your spec document or Notion/Dropbox Paper design doc. The file becomes the living source of truth; a static spec document becomes a problem description + context, not a pixel spec.

### Page Naming as a Status Communication System (From Figma Developer Handoff Guide)

- Use page names to signal implementation readiness — developers should know at a glance whether a page is in-progress, ready for feedback, or ready to build. All three teams at Dropbox, Expedia, and Cash App used page naming for this purpose. Example conventions:
  - `🏗️ WIP — [Feature Name]` — in progress, not ready for review
  - `💭 Review — [Feature Name]` — ready for feedback
  - `🚢 Ready — [Feature Name]` — approved, ready to build
- Emojis in page names serve as fast visual scanners — they break the uniform text list and communicate status before anyone reads the label.
- Set a custom frame as the file thumbnail (right-click > "Set as Thumbnail") so the file browser shows a meaningful preview rather than a random canvas state. Expedia and Cash App both used deliberate thumbnails for better file-browser orientation.

### The "Frame-as-Component" Clean Page Technique (From Figma Developer Handoff Guide — Cash App)

- Cash App's workflow: for every frame ready for developer review, convert it to a component and place an **instance** on a dedicated clean page. The messy working page stays as-is; developers navigate to the clean page.
- The benefit: changes made on the working page automatically propagate to the instance on the clean page — zero manual sync. No duplicate screens to keep updated.
- The clean page contains only final approved screens with clear flow indicators. This removes cognitive load for developers and non-designers who aren't used to reading messy design files.

### Co-Located Component Documentation for "Go to Master Component" (From Figma Developer Handoff Guide — Expedia)

- When a developer selects a component instance, they can click "Go to master component" to jump to its origin. Expedia exploited this navigation: the master component's home page includes a documentation frame directly alongside the component showing its name, description, usage instructions, variants, and states.
- This means the master component page IS the documentation — no external wiki needed. Every developer who inspects an instance can reach full usage documentation in one click.
- Always invite developers into the library files that hold master components. Without access, they get a 404 error when using "Go to master component" — defeating the entire documentation strategy.
- Add component descriptions in the properties sidebar — they appear as tooltips in the components panel and in the code panel during inspection. Use descriptions to include: component name in the codebase, accessibility notes (including contrast guidance), and links to implementation docs.

### Style Names as the Design-to-Code Translation Layer (From Figma Developer Handoff Guide — Expedia + Figma Best Practices)

- Style names appear as comments in the CSS code panel and as line items in table view. If your Figma style name matches your codebase token name, developers can implement the variable directly without translation. If names don't match, you're creating unnecessary mapping work on every handoff.
- Use slash-prefixed groups in style names to mirror your code token structure. Example: `color/brand/primary`, `color/neutral/100`, `type/heading/xl` — these groups display as nested categories in the style picker and map directly to CSS custom property or design token naming conventions.
- Add style descriptions with usage guidance (e.g., "Use for primary CTAs. Min contrast 4.5:1 on white backgrounds"). This surfaces accessibility constraints passively during development.
- Decoupled text styles (Figma separates alignment and color from the style definition) means you don't need a separate style per color/alignment combination — fewer styles, less maintenance, easier for developers to navigate.

### Library Architecture: Single vs. Multi-Library Decision (From Figma Best Practices)

- Small teams (1-3 designers, one product): single library is simpler — one place to find everything, one file to maintain.
- Larger organizations or multi-product teams: split into a **foundation library** (colors, typography, spacing, icons) and **product-specific component libraries** that consume the foundation. This prevents the foundation from being polluted by product-specific components and allows different products to have distinct components while sharing tokens.
- When consuming your own library, treat the designers using it as your end users — apply the same UX thinking you'd use for a product feature. Poor asset panel organization is a usability failure for your design system.

### Variant Property Naming Mirrors Code Props/Values (From Figma Variants Best Practices)

- Variant property names should map directly to component props in code. If your React Button has `variant="primary"`, `variant="secondary"`, your Figma variant property should be named `Variant` with values `Primary` and `Secondary` — not "Type" with values "Solid" and "Outline". The closer the mapping, the less translation a developer needs.
- Forward-slash grouping in layer names converts to variant property values when combining variants — plan your naming before combining to avoid messy migration.
- Component set descriptions and individual variant descriptions both appear in the inspect panel. Write the set description for "what is this component," and the variant description for "when to use this specific variant."

### Grid Styles for Layout Standardization Across Handoff (From Figma Best Practices)

- Create named grid styles — not just for desktop and mobile column grids, but also combined row+column grids used as padding visualizers inside components. A `spacing/component-padding` grid style applied inside a button component lets developers immediately read margins without annotation callouts.
- Grid styles are often overlooked in design systems but are the highest-leverage way to communicate spacing intent during handoff — they translate spacing behavior visually without any redlining.

### Trust and Transparency as the Real Outcome of Collaborative Handoff (From Figma Developer Handoff Guide — Expedia/Ben Munge)

- Expedia's senior iOS developer described the primary benefit of design-developer collaboration in Figma not as "better specs" but as **trust** — seeing the iterations that didn't work built confidence in the decisions that did. When developers can see the whole process, they stop questioning the conclusions.
- Practical implication: don't hide exploration. In-progress pages are not embarrassing — they're evidence of a rigorous process. Sharing often and early prevents "why did it end up like this" questions at build time.
