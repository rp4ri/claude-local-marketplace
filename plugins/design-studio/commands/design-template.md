## Process

### 1. Parse the Request

Extract from `$ARGUMENTS`:
- **Category**: one of the 10 above (required)
- **Brand color**: hex code (e.g., `#6366f1`) — defaults to `#2563eb`
- **Style modifier** (`--style <name>`): minimal | bold | corporate | playful | dark-tech
- **Dark mode** (`--dark`): if present, generate dark-first design
- **Product name**: if mentioned in the task description

If category is unrecognized or missing, ask the user to choose from the list above.

### 2. Set the Design Direction

Before building, establish the design spec:

```
Template: [category]
Brand color: [hex]
Style: [minimal | bold | corporate | playful | dark-tech]
Background: [light | dark]
Typography: [font family choice]
Spacing: [compact | comfortable | spacious]
```

**Style guide:**
- `minimal` — white/light bg, lots of whitespace, thin borders, subtle shadows
- `bold` — strong typography, high contrast, prominent CTAs, full-bleed sections
- `corporate` — professional, serif accents, muted palette, structured layout
- `playful` — rounded corners, colorful gradients, friendly tone
- `dark-tech` — dark background, vibrant accent, code/terminal aesthetic

### 4. Apply Brand Customization

Use the provided brand color to generate a consistent palette:
- **Primary**: use brand color directly
- **Primary-dark**: darken by 15% for hover states
- **Primary-light**: lighten by 40% for backgrounds/tints
- **Neutral scale**: `#111827` → `#f9fafb` (gray-900 to gray-50)
- **Success**: `#16a34a` · **Warning**: `#d97706` · **Error**: `#dc2626`

Typography:
- Use `Inter, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', sans-serif` as the system stack
- Or `'Poppins', sans-serif` for playful style
- Or `'Merriweather', Georgia, serif` for blog/docs

---

### 5. Write Sample Copy

Do not use Lorem Ipsum — write real placeholder copy appropriate to the category:
- **Product/company name**: infer from the request, or use "Acme" as default
- **Headlines**: benefit-driven, specific to category
- **Feature descriptions**: realistic SaaS/product language
- **CTAs**: action-oriented, category-appropriate ("Start free trial" vs "Read the docs" vs "View portfolio")
- **Stats/numbers**: realistic (e.g., "10,000+ teams", "99.9% uptime", "4.8/5 rating")

---

### 6. Build the HTML

Output a complete, single-file HTML/CSS implementation:

**CSS approach:**
- Use CSS custom properties for the color system: `--color-primary`, `--color-bg`, `--color-text`, etc.
- Use CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout
- Include responsive breakpoints: `768px` (tablet) and `1024px` (desktop)
- Include dark mode: `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` OR class-based `.dark` if `--dark` flag

**Code quality:**
- Semantic HTML (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`)
- ARIA labels on interactive elements
- `:hover`, `:focus`, `:active` states on all interactive elements
- Transitions: `0.15s ease` for color/opacity, `0.3s ease` for transforms

**Interactivity (vanilla JS, no dependencies):**
- Mobile navigation hamburger toggle
- Any toggles present in the design (pricing monthly/annual, FAQ accordion, tabs)
- Smooth scroll to sections
- Any form validation state demos

---

### 7. Preview Notes

After outputting the HTML, include:

```
Template: [Category Name]
File: [suggested-filename.html]
Customization applied:
  - Brand color: [hex] + generated palette
  - Style: [style name]
  - Copy: Product name "[X]" used throughout

To customize further:
  - Replace CSS custom properties in :root to rebrand instantly
  - Images: Replace placeholder <div> elements with <img> tags
  - Copy: Search for "Acme" to find all placeholder text

Next steps:
  /design-system — Extract these CSS variables as a design token file
  /email-template — Create an email template matching this design
  /design-framework react-tailwind — Convert to React components
  /figma-create — Recreate this design as a Figma file
```

---

### MCP Fallback

**Without Preview MCP**: Save the output as an HTML file and open in a browser. Chrome DevTools can simulate mobile sizes.

**With Preview MCP**: Start the preview server, write the HTML, and open for visual review. Check at 375px (mobile), 768px (tablet), and 1280px (desktop).

## What's Next

- `/design-system` — Extract the CSS variables as formal design tokens
- `/design-framework <fw>` — Convert this template to React, Vue, Next.js, Svelte, or Astro
- `/email-template` — Build a matching email template for this brand
