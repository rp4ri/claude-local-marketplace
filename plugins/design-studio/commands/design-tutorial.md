## Step 3: Track Exercises

### TRACK: quick-start

**Goal:** Run 3 commands back-to-back. See what Design Studio produces.

---

**Exercise 1 of 3 — Design a UI Component**

Run this command now (copy it exactly):

```
/design a primary button with hover, focus, and disabled states
```

> **What to watch for:** Notice how the response assembles a team (UI Designer + Accessibility Auditor), produces semantic HTML with CSS custom properties, and includes WCAG contrast ratios. This is one command doing what would take a designer + developer 20 minutes.

Once you see the output, continue to Exercise 2.

---

**Exercise 2 of 3 — Review What You Just Built**

Take the HTML from Exercise 1 and run:

```
/design-review [paste the HTML output here]
```

> **What to watch for:** The Design Critique role evaluates against heuristics, the Accessibility Auditor runs WCAG checks. You get a scored report with specific fixes. This is the QA loop — build, review, iterate.

---

**Exercise 3 of 3 — Generate a Framework Component**

Run:

```
/design-framework react-tailwind [paste the HTML from Exercise 1]
```

> **What to watch for:** The Framework Specialist converts generic HTML/CSS to idiomatic React + Tailwind with TypeScript interfaces, proper prop types, and composable component structure. This is the design-to-code pipeline in one command.

---

**Quick-start complete.** You've seen:
- `/design` → HTML/CSS with specialist knowledge
- `/design-review` → scored quality audit
- `/design-framework` → idiomatic framework code

**Suggested next tracks:**
- `/design-tutorial ui` for the full component pipeline
- `/design-tutorial figma` if you use Figma
- `/design-tutorial data-viz` for dashboards and charts

---

### TRACK: ui

**Goal:** Build a card component from scratch → extract design tokens → generate developer handoff documentation.

---

**Exercise 1 — Build the Component**

```
/design a product card: thumbnail image, title, subtitle, price, and CTA button. Modern minimal style.
```

> **What's happening:** The Creative Director defines visual direction. The UI Designer specifies the component structure, spacing system, and CSS custom properties. The Content Designer writes placeholder copy. All three specialists contribute to a single output.

---

**Exercise 2 — Extract Tokens**

After reviewing the card output, run:

```
/design-system extract tokens from the product card output above
```

> **What's happening:** The Design System Lead analyzes the output's CSS custom properties and raw values to produce a structured token map — semantic tokens (e.g., `--color-surface-elevated`) linked to primitive tokens (e.g., `--color-neutral-100`). This is the foundation for a scalable design system.

---

**Exercise 3 — Generate Developer Handoff**

```
/design-handoff generate handoff documentation for the product card
```

> **What's happening:** The Design QA specialist produces a developer spec: spacing grid, color values, typography stack, interactive state documentation, and copy for the handoff comment in Jira/Linear. This bridges the design-dev gap without a Zeplin subscription.

---

**UI track complete.** Full pipeline: build → tokenize → handoff.

**Suggested next:** `/design-tutorial figma` to do this natively in Figma.

---

### TRACK: figma

**Goal:** Create a button component in Figma with all states → add mobile responsive variant → wire a prototype.

> **Prerequisite:** This track uses the Figma Desktop Bridge MCP. If you don't have it, each command includes a fallback (it'll describe what to build instead of creating it live).

---

**Exercise 1 — Create in Figma**

```
/figma-create a button component with default, hover, focus, disabled states. Use auto layout.
```

> **What's happening:** The Figma Creator role uses the Figma API to build the component programmatically — auto layout, component properties, variant groups. No clicking required.

---

**Exercise 2 — Add Responsive Variants**

```
/figma-responsive make the button responsive: full-width on mobile (< 375px), auto-width on desktop
```

> **What's happening:** The responsive variants command creates viewport-specific instances of the component, respects Figma's auto layout constraints, and groups them for easy comparison in a single frame.

---

**Exercise 3 — Wire a Prototype**

```
/figma-prototype wire the button states: click → focus state, hover → hover state
```

> **What's happening:** The Prototype Designer adds Figma interaction triggers and transitions between frames — hover overlays, click destinations, transition easing. Produces a testable prototype without leaving the command line.

---

**Figma track complete.** Figma-native creation pipeline.

**Suggested next:** `/figma-sync` to check design/code drift on an existing project.

---

### TRACK: social

**Goal:** Design an Instagram post → build a 30-day content calendar → create an analytics performance dashboard.

---

**Exercise 1 — Design a Post**

```
/social-content Instagram carousel: 5 slides announcing a new SaaS product feature
```

> **What's happening:** The Social Media Designer defines aspect ratios, text-safe zones, and visual hierarchy per platform. The Social Media Copywriter writes slide-by-slide captions with hook, body, and CTA. Output includes production-ready image specs you can hand to a designer or use with Canva/Figma.

---

**Exercise 2 — Plan the Campaign**

```
/social-campaign 30-day LinkedIn + Instagram launch campaign for the feature above
```

> **What's happening:** The Social Media Strategist maps content pillars, post cadence, and platform-specific formats. Output: a structured calendar with post types, captions, hashtag banks, and optimal posting times. The Growth Specialist adds a KPI framework to measure success.

---

**Exercise 3 — Build the Analytics Dashboard**

```
/social-analytics build a performance dashboard tracking: impressions, engagement rate, follower growth, reach by platform
```

> **What's happening:** The Growth/Analytics Specialist designs a KPI card layout with sparklines, comparison metrics (vs. previous period), and a per-platform breakdown table. Outputs HTML/CSS dashboard you can integrate into any reporting tool.

---

**Social track complete.** Content creation → campaign planning → measurement.

---

### TRACK: email

**Goal:** Build a welcome email template → expand to a 3-email onboarding sequence.

---

**Exercise 1 — Build the Welcome Email**

```
/email-template welcome email for a SaaS project management tool. Include: hero with product screenshot placeholder, 3 feature highlights, primary CTA to "Start your first project"
```

> **What's happening:** The Email Designer writes table-based layout HTML (not flexbox/grid — these aren't supported in email clients), applies inline styles for Outlook compatibility, and adds VML bulletproof buttons. The Email Copywriter writes subject line options and preview text with open-rate optimization notes.

---

**Exercise 2 — Expand to a Sequence**

```
/email-campaign 3-email onboarding sequence for the tool above. Day 1: welcome. Day 3: first project tip. Day 7: upgrade prompt.
```

> **What's happening:** Output includes all three HTML templates plus: campaign brief, send timing strategy, subject line A/B test suggestions, ESP variable syntax (Mailchimp/Klaviyo/SendGrid), and CAN-SPAM compliance checklist. A complete ready-to-import campaign package.

---

**Email track complete.** Single template → full campaign sequence.

---

### TRACK: data-viz

**Goal:** Design an accessible bar chart → build a complete analytics dashboard.

---

**Exercise 1 — Design a Chart**

```
/chart-design monthly active users trend for 2025, compared against 2024. Show growth annotations.
```

> **What's happening:** The Data Viz Designer selects chart type from a 16-type matrix (line for trends, not bar — bar is for comparisons). Applies a colorblind-safe sequential palette. Adds meaningful annotations at inflection points. Outputs Chart.js with `<details>` data table fallback for screen readers.

---

**Exercise 2 — Build a Dashboard**

```
/dashboard-layout analytics dashboard: 4 KPI cards (MAU, DAU, retention, churn), main trend chart, acquisition channel breakdown, data table of top cohorts
```

> **What's happening:** The Dashboard Architect applies information hierarchy (overview → trend → detail), CSS Grid layout with KPI row + chart split + full-width table, responsive collapse strategy per breakpoint, and skeleton loading states. All in semantic HTML with CSS custom properties and dark mode.

---

**Data-viz track complete.** Chart design → full dashboard.

---

### TRACK: full

**Goal:** Complete tour of all 8 design wings.

Run each exercise in order. Each builds on the last.

1. **UI Foundation** → `/design a minimal landing page hero: headline, subheadline, email signup CTA`
2. **Design Review** → `/design-review [paste hero output]`
3. **Token Extraction** → `/design-system extract tokens from the hero`
4. **Brand Kit** → `/brand-kit generate brand system from color #3B82F6 (blue). SaaS product.`
5. **Framework Export** → `/design-framework react-tailwind [paste hero HTML]`
6. **Template** → `/design-template landing-page --style minimal`
7. **Figma Creation** → `/figma-create a hero section with the brand kit above`
8. **Social** → `/social-content Instagram Story: launch announcement for the product above`
9. **Email** → `/email-template welcome email with the brand kit above`
10. **Data Viz** → `/chart-design user signups last 30 days as a line chart`
11. **Dashboard** → `/dashboard-layout growth dashboard: signups KPI, revenue KPI, activation rate, chart area`
12. **Handoff** → `/design-handoff generate developer spec for everything above`

> This is the full Design Studio workflow — idea to developer-ready in 12 commands.
